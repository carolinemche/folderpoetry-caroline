my journal is my most priceless posession. inside my journal are hundreds of entries of my day. it is a nightly tradition i practice to let out all my locked up feelings or thoughts i had that day. it is also a way i reflect on myself and make myself a better person. it belongs to me and only me. no one will understand it but me ðŸ“–.
