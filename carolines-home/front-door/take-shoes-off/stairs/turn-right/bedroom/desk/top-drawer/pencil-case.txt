my pencil case is home to my most impulsvie purchases. who knew i needed an absurd amount of pens 🖊, pencils ✏️, anppulsive purchases. who knew i needed an absurd amount of pens 🖊, pencils, and markers 🖍 ? my personal favorites are muji but i still will buy anything i think i need. it is also home to a chaotic mess because i refuse to organize it so when you open it, my pencils are probably all falling out. i use them for my journal and all my school notes.
