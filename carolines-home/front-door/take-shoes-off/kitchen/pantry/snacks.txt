🍿🥨 in school, i was known for having the best snacks. this was thanks to my mom and my pantry. my mom would always get my favorite snacks and store a surplus of it. when i came back from school, i would go straight to the pantry and get my all-time favorite, doritos, but we had all the snacks imagineable🍿🥨
