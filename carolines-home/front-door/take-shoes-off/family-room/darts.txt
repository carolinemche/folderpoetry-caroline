🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯 the dart board situated in my family room is a classic tradition. every christmas, friends and family, would all take a turn at the dart board, trying to score the highest points. mebeing a terrible player would always practice before the big event. you could hear the darts hitting the wall instead of the board followed by my mom telling me to be careful. 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
